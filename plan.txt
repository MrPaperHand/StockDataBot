Day 13: 6/20/23
Tasks: Fix Code is your only task buddy lol.
Accomplished: Very little
Notes: Man I don't know. Either I'm using explicit waits incorrectly or it's just inherrently very hard to get the program to run fully without crashing in 
       web automation without completley fine tuning it. I think I'm going to take a break from using explicit waits and this project. I'll either clean up 
       my code tmrw and put things into functions and whatnot or I'll just put the project on hold while I learn other QA stuff.

Day 12: 6/18/23
Tasks: Fix Code is your only task buddy lol.
Accomplished: Realized one of the click on to the apply was changed with a click NYSE checkbox. Fixed that. Trying to figure out why it still crashes when
              I let it run. I guess clicking step by step through the debugger won't work for web automation stuff because of page loading and what not. 
              The "DOM" as they so spookily call it. I suspect I'm still not using explicit wait correctly, but I'll be so happy once I finally figure it out.
Notes: I should probably just copy paste this Day X: Tasks: etc stuff. Started uploading to github yesterday and will continue to day. I wanna see GREEEEEN. 


Day 11: 6/15/23
Accomplished:
    1. Learned the value of using breakpoints and debugging step by step... Embarrassing it took me 6 months after graduating with a acs degree 
       to realize this.
    2. I think I got the explicit waits to work, I just need to check up on the element to be selected one.

Day 10: 6/13/23
Tasks:
    1. Complete changing the computer to use it's ssd.
    2. Correctly implement explicit wait.
Accomplished:
    1. Completed changing my computer to use ssd. 
Notes:
    1. Fuuuuuuuuck SAAAAAAKE. I've realized another tedieous thing about web automation is that the website appears to be constantly changing it's 
       code and I have to re-update it so it can work again. This is going to tremendously slow my progress for this project. This makes me think about
       what project ideas are even worth doing. Especially considering the larger my project grows, the more I will have to re-factor it... 

Day 9: 6/12/23
Tasks:
    1. Move everything to the ssd drive...
    2. Correctly implement explicit wait.

Day 8: 6/11/23
Tasks: 
    1. Did not do it right as I previously thought. Get selenium to get to second page after going through all 25 stocks.
    2. Start implementing explicit wait instead of time.sleep.
Accomplished:
    1. Task 1, although it only clicks the first stock and is stuck there, although I noticed this "getting stuck" seems to happen seemingly randomly
       and unfortunatly quite often so it's possible it just got stuck like the other situations. It may be solved by correctly implementing explicit wait
       but I'm not sure.
    2. Implemented explicit wait although I suspect not correctly heh heh. Lets just say I got to fix that.
Notes: 
    1. I realize that making every smallest step go as fast as possible one at a time is much better than creating a giant slow proccess that takes a long 
       time to run.
    2. I've become distrought by the work recently, but as I've learned from the gym, these periods of struggle is when you grow the most.

Day 7: 6/10/23
Tasks:
    1. Complete day 4 task 6. "Use webdriver wait instead of time.sleep"
Accomplished:
    1. Discovered things were more complicated than I thought. 

Day 6: 6/9/23
Tasks: 
    1. Continue on with day 4 tasks.
Accomplished:
    1. Day 4, task 5
Notes:
    1. Discovered that there is an implicit wait and an explicit wait. Apparently implicit wait's are not commonly used and considered by many to be
       dumb. That said explicit wait seems to be more complicated than I thought. I originially thought I would just put something liek "explicitWait(2)"
       but it is actually conditional and will take some time. So I will do this task tmrw or the day after.

Day 5: 6/8/23
Tasks: 
    1. Continue on with day 4 tasks. Embarrassingly low progress lol.
    2. Make program go full screen at start.
Accomplished:
    1. Completed task 2 of day 4. Task 3 of day 4 isn't that interesting and I don't feel like it so skip for now. Same with task 4 of day 4. 
       Still need to do task 5 and 6 of day 4.
    2. Completed task 2. 
Notes:
    1. Discovered that I can do other things on my computer while Selenium runs. Silly me. 
    2. I'm only doing a little bit day by day, but I actually made a decent amount of progress thinking about it.

Day 4: 6/7/23
Tasks: 
    1. Rearange plan.txt folder so new day is on top instead of bottom.
    2. Make code save ticker symbol and PE ratios to spreadsheet.
    3. Don't want to sit around waiting for it to finish. Should add some way to count the time. Perhaps put a timestamp at the start and end of the program.
       I also need a way to make sure it went through successfully. Guess I'll move saving the ticker symbol above this task.
    4. Reduce 5 seconds to something less that still works. Track the times.
    5. Make code move onto second page and etc.
    6. Use webdriver wait instead of time.sleep.
Accomplished:
    1. Task 1 completed. Nothing much else to say here.
Notes:
    1. Including a notes section from now on. 
    2. I took L Theanine today. Will see if it increases my work output.    

Day 3: 6/5/23
Tasks:
    1. Change it so that instead of clicking just the first stock, it clicks through every stock on the page.
Accomplished:
    Finished Task 1. Didn't do much, but am tired today lol. Tested what I planned on Day 2. Worked sometimes and didn't work other times. I think I'm going to look
    into the error in more detail when when I have time, perhaps Sunday when I don't have work. Also have some plans on what to add on to the project. Firstly reduce 
    5 seconds to something less. Not sure how much less, but I'll see how low I can go tmrw. Secondly I want to make the code move onto the second page after the 25th 
    stock (each page has 25 stocks). Lastly I wanna add all the tickers along with their PE ratios onto a spread sheet, but this will be done a bit later, I'll do 
    this on day 5 or 6 probably.

Day 2: 6/4/23
Tasks:
    1. Click on the United States checkbox in the country selections and click filter
    2. Click on the first stock to go to that stock's webpage
Accomplished:
    Finished Task 1 and 2. I learned that I need to actually scroll down the page to be able to get selenium to click on an element. Makes sense I guess.
    Also, had a weird error where the css selector for an company stock symbol to click on gave the next stock after it instead of itself (element 1 being element 2 instead).
    I solved the issue by using time.sleep(). I suspect the page not loading as fast as the program runs is causing errors. I plan on using time.sleep(50) tmrw to see if the
    error "handshake failed; returned -1, blah blah blah" will go away if I let the page fully load. I'll add more time if needed to test. Selenium and/or Python seems very
    slow.

Day 1: 6/3/23
Tasks:
    1. Open https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener for the list of stocks 
    Note: Can easily download a csv file from the page, but I think that defeats the purpose of learning Selenium
Accomplished:
    Finished task 1. Getting python to work was a pain, but I solved it by uninstalling the old python version 3.7.5 and installing the latest version
    3.11.3 with env variable option checked. It had the "correct" path too, I think my old one was wrong for whatever reason
